Therefore, you are not recommended to directly use root account. On Linux systems, sudo is used as the default root identity for standard users. Next, we have some commands for managing users and groups. groupadd: create a new work group, whose info is added to /etc/group, /etc/gshadow and so on.

It’s usually specified with -g when creating a user. The GID in the user info (/etc/passwd) is login group. A user’s additional group is to assign additional permission to the specified user.

In turn, a series of shell scripts called Init Scripts (located in /etc) are run, which can start all system services. Many of these system services are implemented in the form of daemons, which run only in the background without any user interface (inaccessible). Here are some of the command-line tools available: ps: To view the snapshot of process status; common parameter aux (show all processes) 1234567ubuntu@VM-16-17-ubuntu:/etc$ ps auxUSER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND# TTY: ? denotes terminal running locally, Pts/n denotes terminal running remotely# VSZ: virtual memory size# RSS: physical memory size occupied by process# STAT: R(running), S(sleeping), D(uninterruptible sleeping), T(terminal), Z(zombie) &lt;(high priority) N(low priority) Ctrl-C: send a SIGIN Ctrl-D: send a EOF Ctrl-Z: send a SIGSTP, pause ongoing process on the terminal so as to be resumed when necessary. top: To displays a continuously updated list of system process in order of process activity (default, refresh per 3s); jobs: bg: fg: kill: To send signals to programs (kill [-signal] PID...); NO. NAME EXPLANATION 1 HUP Hang up, this signal is used to tell the program that the control terminal has “hung up.” You can show what this signal does by closing a terminal session. Foreground programs running on the current terminal will receive this signal and terminate. Many daemons also use this signal to re-initialize. 2 INT like Ctrl-c 9 KILL The KILL signal is never sent to the target program. Instead, the kernel immediately terminates the process. When a process is terminated in this way, it has no opportunity to do any “cleaning” or saving work. 15 TERM Terminal, this is default signal sent by KILL 18 CONT Continue, after getting a stop signal, program will be resumed by CONT 19 STOP like KILL, STOP is not sent to the target process, so it cannot be ignored 其他常用信号： NO. NAME EXPLANATION 3 QUIT 11 SEGV If a program uses memory illegally, this signal will be sent 20 TSTP Ctrl-z will trigger this signal to cause terminal stop, unlike STOP, it can be ignored killall: To send signals to multiple processes that match a particular program or username (killall [-u user] [-signal] name...); shutdown: To shutdown the machine or reboot; Shell Environment printenv: set: To display existing shell variables in the system and set new variable values for shell variables. When user log in to the system, the bash program starts and reads a series of configuration scripts (startup files that define a default environment for all users), then it reads the startup files in the home directory that define the user’s personal shell environment. The exact startup order depends on the type of shell session you want to run. There are two types, one is login shell session (need username and password), the other is non-login shell session (start under the GUI). Login shell startup order: File Usage &#x2F;etc&#x2F;profile global conf script applying to all users ~&#x2F;.bash_profile user’s personal startup file, used to extend or override settings in global conf script ~&#x2F;.bash_login if ~&#x2F;.bash_profile is not found, bash will try to read this script Non-login shell startup order: File Usage &#x2F;etc&#x2F;bash.bashrc global conf script applying to all users ~&#x2F;.bashrc user’s personal startup file, used to extend or override settings in global conf script In addition to reading the startup files above, non-login shell also inherit the environment settings of their parent process, usually a login shell. In general users’ points, the file ~&#x2F;.bashrc is probably the most important startup file because it’s almost always read. Non-login shells read it by default, and most startup files for login shells are written in such a way that they can read ~&#x2F;.bashrc . The below is a typical .bash_profile file (From CentOS 4): 12345678# .bash_profile# Get the aliaes and functionsif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then. ~/.bashrcfi# User specific environment and startup programsPATH=$PATH:$HOME/binexport PATH export: export environment variables; alias: create alias for command; Refref1","tags":[{"name":"shell","slug":"shell","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/shell/"},{"name":"linux","slug":"linux","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/linux/"}],"categories":[{"name":"languages","slug":"languages","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/languages/"},{"name":"shell","slug":"languages/shell","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/languages/shell/"}]},{"title":"Memo | Parameter Estimation","date":"2023-08-30T05:56:53.000Z","path":"jottings/mathematics/memo_mle_mae_bayes/","text":"Through this note, I hope to deepen my understanding of probability distribution and inference. Preface Probability: to predict results obtained in the next observation when parameters are known; Statistic&#x2F;Likelihood: to estimate parameters about properties when the result of observations are known; Parametric Method: assume that the learned distribution has a specific functional form (like Gaussian distribution or exponential p.d.f), we only estimate the parameters in these functions. Nonparametric Method: use the training samples to estimate the density of any point in the domain. Nonparametric methods also have parameters, we just don’t assume any specific functional form for distribution; Actually, nonparametric methods treat all training samples as parameters; example: kernel density estimation; Under the joint distribution $p_{X,Y}(X,Y)$: When the effect of $Y$ is removed from the joint distribution $p_{X,Y}(X,Y)$, marginal distribution $p_X(X)$ is called marginal likelihood; When $X$ has not yet been observed, marginal distribution $p_Y(Y)$ is called prior distribution; Posterior Distribution: $p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D}) &#x3D; \\frac{p(\\mathcal{D},\\theta)}{p(\\mathcal{D})}$, concentrating Population Info, Sample Info and Prior Info; $p(\\mathcal{D})$ is marginal likelihood; $\\text{Posterior} &#x3D; \\frac{\\text{Likelihood}\\times \\text{Prior}}{\\text{Marginal Likelihood}}$, in terms of $p(Y|X) &#x3D; \\frac{1}{Z}p(X|Y)p(Y)$, $Z&#x3D;p(X)&gt;0$ is a normalized constant such that $p(Y|X)$ is a valid probability distribution. The Views Frequentist: Data are repeatable random sample - there is a frequency; Underlying parameters remain constant during this repeatable process; Parameters are fixed value; statistical inference: Population Info + Sample Info MLE, MAP; Bayesian: Data are observed from the realized sample; Parameters are unknown (random variable) and described probabilistically (prior distribution); statistical inference: Population Info + Sample Info + Prior Info (Main Diff); Bayesian Estimation; Notations Training Data: $\\mathcal{D} &#x3D; { (\\mathbf{x_1}, y_1),\\cdots,(\\mathbf{x}_n, y_n) }$; Model Parameter: $\\theta$; New Data: $x^*$; Maximum Likelihood Estimation Objective is$$\\theta_{MLE}^* &#x3D; \\arg\\max_\\theta p(\\mathcal{D}|\\theta)$$ $p(\\mathcal{D}|\\theta)$ is likelihood, not conditional probability; Usually, we define$$\\mathscr{l}(\\theta) &#x3D; p(\\mathcal{D}|\\theta) \\\\mathscr{ll}(\\theta) &#x3D; \\ln \\mathscr{l}(\\theta)$$So, objective is equivalent to$$\\theta_{MLE}^* &#x3D; \\arg\\max_\\theta \\mathscr{ll}(\\theta)$$That is, we seek those values for the parameters in $\\theta$ which maximize $p(\\mathcal{D}|\\theta)$. The MLE solution is usually obtained by setting$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{ll}(\\theta)}{\\partial\\theta} &#x3D; 0$$ However, the model… Does not incorporate prior belief; Easy to overfit the data; Maximum A Posteri Estimation Objective is$$\\theta^*_{MAP} &#x3D; \\arg\\max_\\theta p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})$$Since we have Bayes rule:$$p(\\theta | \\mathcal{D}) &#x3D; \\frac{p(\\mathcal{D})p(\\theta)}{p(\\mathcal{D})}$$Our objective is equivalent to$$\\theta^*_{MAP} &#x3D; \\arg\\max_\\theta p(\\mathcal{D}|\\theta)p(\\theta)$$Further, by taking the log$$\\theta^*_{MAP} &#x3D; \\arg\\max_\\theta {\\ln p(\\mathcal{D}|\\theta) + lnp(\\theta) } \\\\theta^*_{MAP} &#x3D; \\arg\\max_\\theta { \\mathscr{ll}(\\theta) + \\ln p(\\theta) }$$Thus, our final goal is to find$$\\theta^*_{MAP} &#x3D; \\arg\\max_\\theta { \\mathscr{ll}(\\theta) + \\ln p(\\theta) }$$The difference between MAP and MLE is the “extra” term - $p(\\theta)$. The term is: our prior (belief) also can be seen as penalty (regularization) - to reduce the overfitting. For $p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})$, in terms of point estimation for $\\theta$, using the maximum value is called Maximum A Posterior Estimation; using the median value is called Posteriror Median Estimation; using the expectation value is called Posterior Expectation Estimation; Bayesian Estimation $p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})$ (it’s the result of adjustments to prior $p(\\theta)$ by population and sample); Equal Ignorance: If there’s no information about the prior distribution, assume $\\theta \\sim U(0,1)$ ; Learning: Computing the posterior $p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})$ ; Prediction: $p(\\hat y | x^*,\\mathcal{D}) &#x3D; \\int_\\theta p(\\hat y | x^*,\\theta)p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})d\\theta$ ; Both MLE and MAP return only single and specific values for the paramter $\\theta$; Bayesian estimation, by contrast, calculates fully the posterior distribution $p(\\theta|\\mathcal{D})$, and making prediction by considering all possible $\\theta$.

In CPython, GIL is a mutex lock used to ensure that only on thread is executing at a time within a process. In the absence of the GIL, it’s possible for multiple threads executing the same code simultaneously to cause incorrect reference counting of variables, leading to the garbage collector directly reclaiming the variables involved in the executed code. This can result in errors when other threads attempt to use those reclaimed variables. How to work: Each thread acquires the GIL at the beginning of its execution to prevent other threads from preempting. Similarly, after each thread completes a segment of code (or before system calls that may cause blocking, such as IO operations), it releases the GIL to allow other threads to utilize resources. In CPython, there’s another mechanism called check_interval, where the interpreter periodically checks the status of the GIL lock for threads. After a certain interval, the interpreter forces the current thread to release the GIL, allowing other threads to have opportunity to execute. Overall, each Python thread is encapsulated in a similar loop structure. Let’s take a look at the following code: 12345678910111213for (;;) &#123; if (--ticker &lt; 0) &#123; ticker = check_interval; /* Give another thread a chance */ PyThread_release_lock(interpreter_lock); /* Other thread may run now */ PyThread_acquire_lock(interpreter_lock); &#125; bytecode = *next_instr++; switch(bytecode) &#123; /* execute the next instruction ... */ &#125;&#125; The above example represents instruction counting, while the current approach is mostly based on time slicing. Here’s another example that demonstrates GIL’s working principle: 123456789101112131415161718# coding=utf-8from threading import Threadfrom multiprocessing import Processdef test(): # endless loop for full CPU utilization while True: pass# multi-thread version:# t1 = Thread(target=test)# multi-process version:t1 = Process(target=test)t1.start()# main thread executionwhile True: pass When the multi-thread code running, we can observe the CPU utilization from htop as shown below: 121 [50%]2 [50%] According to the above, we can know that each thread spends their a half time waiting for GIL. Additionally, the multi-process version as shown below: 121 [100%]2 [100%] The other way to utilize multi-core CPU is Multi-Process or Coroutine GeneratorGenerator contains the yield keyword to produce values. It has the following characteristics: Laziness: Generators are lazy in nature, meaning they produce values on-demand as requested by the caller, rather than generating all the values at once. This lazy evaluation allows for efficient memory usage, especially when dealing with large or infinite sequences. Memory efficiency: Due to their lazy evaluation, generators are memory-efficient. Iterability: Generators are iterable objects, which means they can be looped over using a for loop or consumed by other iterable functions like list() or sum(). They provide a convenient way to iterate over a sequence of values without the need to store the entire sequence in memory. State persistence: Generators maintain their internal state between successive calls. When a generator function is paused at a yield statement, the local variables’ values are preserved. This allows the generator to resume execution from where it left off, retaining the necessary information to generate the next value. Infinite sequences: Generators can be used to represent infinite sequences since they generate values on-the-fly. Function-like behavior: Generators are defined using the def keyword like regular functions, and they can have parameters, return values, and other function features. However, they differ in their execution behavior, as they can be paused and resumed. When the generator function finishes executing (no more yield statements or returns), the generator object raises a StopIteration exception. yield from is a syntactic sugar that allows delegation of generator execution within a generator function. It provides a concise way to call a sub-generator from a parent generator and directly pass the values yielded by the sub-generator to the parent generator. 123456789101112def sub_generator(): yield &#x27;A&#x27; yield &#x27;B&#x27; yield &#x27;C&#x27; def parent_generator(): yield &#x27;START&#x27; yield from sub_generator() yield &#x27;END&#x27; for item in parent_generator(): print(item) yield and send are used together to allow the generator function to receive values during each iteration and send values back into the generator function for processing. Here is an example of how yield and send are used: 1234567891011121314151617def generator_function(): result = yield # First call, receives a value sent by send() while True: print(&#x27;gen&#x27;, result) result = yield resultgen = generator_function()# Start the generatornext(gen) # or gen.send(None)output = gen.send(&quot;Hello&quot;)print(&#x27;out&#x27;, output)output = gen.send(&quot;World&quot;)print(&#x27;out&#x27;, output)# print result:# gen Hello# out Hello# gen World# out World generator.throw(AnyException) allows generator to throw an Exception, and generator.close() can stop the generator. CoroutineCoroutines are implemented using generator functions and the yield statement. The principle of coroutines is as follows: Coroutine Function Definition: Define a generator function as a coroutine function. This function can use the yield statement to specify suspension points, where it pauses execution and returns a value to the caller. Coroutine Initialization: Create a coroutine object by calling the coroutine function. Coroutine Iteration: Use the next() function or the .send() method of the coroutine object to iterate and execute the coroutine. When the coroutine encounters a yield statement, it pauses execution and returns the result to the caller. Coroutine Resumption: When the caller sends a value to the coroutine (using the .send() method), the coroutine resumes execution from the last paused position and uses the sent value as the result of the yield expression. Coroutine Termination: When the coroutine reaches the end of the function or encounters a StopIteration exception, the coroutine terminates. Further calls to the .send() method on the coroutine object will raise a StopIteration exception. Coroutines allow achieving concurrent execution without the need for multiple threads or processes. Coroutines can switch between different execution paths, enabling efficient asynchronous programming. Coroutines can also delegate to other coroutines using the yield from statement, enabling more complex cooperation and task decomposition. Python provides the asyncio module to support coroutine programming, where the async and await keywords offer a more concise syntax for defining and managing coroutines. With asyncio, it becomes easy to write asynchronous programs and handle tasks like I&#x2F;O operations, network communication, and more. It’s important to note that coroutines run in a single thread, so their performance may not be as good as multi-threading or multiprocessing when it comes to CPU-bound tasks. However, in I&#x2F;O-bound tasks, coroutines shine because they can effectively utilize the waiting time for I&#x2F;O to execute other tasks. Async&#x2F;Await async def is a keyword combination used in Python to define asynchronous functions. An asynchronous function is a special type of function that can contain await expressions, which suspend the execution of the function and wait for the completion of asynchronous operations. Here is a example: 12345678910111213141516import asyncio# Define an asynchronous functionasync def async_func(): print(&quot;Start&quot;) await asyncio.sleep(1) # Suspend function execution using await, waiting for the completion of an asynchronous operation print(&quot;End&quot;)# Run the asynchronous function in an event loopasync def main(): await async_func()# Create an event loop and run the main functionloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()loop.run_until_complete(main())loop.close() await is a keyword used to suspend the execution of an asynchronous function and wait for the completion of an asynchronous operation. await can only be used within an asynchronous context and is typically used in conjunction with async def. The general usage of await is as follows: Use await within an asynchronous function or coroutine to suspend its execution and wait for the completion of an asynchronous operation. For example: 123async def async_func(): result = await async_operation() # 等待 async_operation() 异步操作的完成 # 继续异步操作，使用异步操作的结果 result Note that await can only be used within asynchronous functions or coroutines. It is not valid to use await in synchronous code. Typically, await is followed by an awaitable object, such as an asynchronous function, coroutine, asynchronous iterator, etc. These awaitable objects must implement specific protocols, which include methods like __await__() or __aiter__(). The await expression invokes these methods to obtain an iterator or a context manager from the awaitable object and waits for its completion. Here are some common awaitable objects: Asynchronous functions or coroutines: Use await to wait for the execution of an asynchronous function or coroutine to complete. Asynchronous generators: Use await to iterate over asynchronous generators and wait for each generated value. Asynchronous iterators: Use await to iterate over asynchronous iterators and wait for each iteration value. Asynchronous context managers: Use await to enter and exit the context of an asynchronous context manager. For example: 123456async def async_func(): async with async_context_manager() as cm: await cm.do_something() # Wait for the completion of the asynchronous context manager async for item in async_iterator(): await process_item(item) # Wait for the completion of each item generated by the asynchronous iterator","tags":[{"name":"python","slug":"python","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/python/"}],"categories":[{"name":"languages","slug":"languages","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/languages/"},{"name":"python","slug":"languages/python","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/languages/python/"}]},{"title":"Memo | Optimization Algorithm in Machine Learning","date":"2023-08-05T14:56:53.000Z","path":"jottings/mathematics/memo_optimization_alg/","text":"Reproduced in The Summary of Optimization Algorithm in ML For machine learning algorithms with diverse forms and characteristics, we have various optimization algorithms suitable for optimizing their objective functions.

Analytical solutions are typically used for linear regression, logistic regression, and certain types of optimization problems with closed-form solutions.

It creates an additional entry in the file system that points to the same inode (data structure representing a file) as the original file. Changes made to either the original file or the hard link are reflected in both, as they refer to the same underlying data. Hard links cannot reference directories or files on different file systems or partitions. Soft Links: A symbolic link is a special file that contains a path pointing to another file or directory. It acts as a pointer or shortcut to the target file or directory. Symbolic links are independent files and have their own inodes. Modifying the original file or symbolic link does not affect each other, as they are separate entities. Symbolic links can reference directories or files on different file systems or partitions. Soft links can be created to a non-existent filename (of course, if you use vi on this soft link file, Linux will automatically create a new file named “filename”). Hard links cannot be created in such cases since the file must already exist, and the inode must exist as well. Using ls -li can view the inodes of the files. drwxrwxr-x 2 ‘s 2 is the number of hard links to a file.

Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain (what to do), rather than specifying all the details of how the program should achieve the result (how to do). Imperative Programming uses statements that change a program’s state. Imperative Programming focuses on describing how a program operates step by step, rather than on high-level descriptions of its expected results. KVM: Kernel-based Virtual Machine, is a virtualization infrastructure used in the Linux kernel to turn the Linux kernel into a hypervisor; Hypervisor: creates and runs virtual machines, sometimes called a virtual machine monitor (VMM), like a meta-OS; IT resource pooled, OS and hardware decoupled, allocated according to needs; A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine; (Type 1) Native or bare mental hypervisor: runs directly on the host’s hardware to manage guest operating systems. It takes the place of a host operating system and VM resources are scheduled directly to the hardware by the hypervisor. This type of hypervisor is most common in an enterprise data center or other server-based environments. KVM, Microsoft Hyper-V, and VMware vSphere are examples of a type 1 hypervisor. KVM was merged into the Linux kernel in 2007, so if you’re using a modern version of Linux, you already have access to KVM. (Type 2) Hosted hypervisor: run on a conventional operating system as a software layer or application. It works by abstracting guest operating systems from the host operating system. VM resources are scheduled against a host operating system, which is then executed against the hardware. A type 2 hypervisor is better for individual users who want to run multiple operating systems on a personal computer. VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox are examples of a type 2 hypervisor. (Emulator) The difference with the Hypervisor is that the Hypervisor runs the same VM and host CPU architecture, while the Emulator can be used to run systems or programs on other hardware platforms (arm, mips, x86). When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your x86 PC). By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance; QEMU can use other hypervisors like Xen or KVM to use CPU extensions (HVM) for virtualization. When used as a virtualizer, QEMU achieves near native performances by executing the guest code directly on the host CPU. When QEMU is used in conjunction with KVM, KVM provides hardware virtualization support, while QEMU is responsible for virtual machine simulation and management. In this configuration, KVM functions as a Hypervisor to directly interact with hardware and provide high-performance virtualization support, while QEMU runs on the upper layer of KVM and is responsible for VM simulation and management, including device simulation, VM creation, start, and stop. So while QEMU is not a traditional Hypervisor on its own, when used in conjunction with KVM, QEMU can work with KVM to provide a complete virtualization solution and act as part of a Hypervisor.","tags":[{"name":"points","slug":"points","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/points/"}],"categories":[{"name":"tidbits","slug":"tidbits","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/tidbits/"}]},{"title":"TBR_compiler","date":"2023-07-22T12:00:53.000Z","path":"jottings/tidbits/tbr_compiler/","text":"《编译原理》课件搬运 ——&gt; 源地址 1.1 编译器作用 编译器（Compiler） 读入以某种语言（源语言）编写的程序； 输出等价的用另一种语言（目标语言）编写的程序； 通常目标程序是可执行的； 解释器（Interpreter） 不生成目标程序，直接根据源程序的语义执行源程序中指定的操作； Java语言的处理结合了编译(.class字节码)和解释，Python会将编译的字节码(pyc)存放于_pycache_(可跨平台部署，一定程度防源码泄露，import的py不变pyc就不变[检查py和pyc的修改时间是否一致]) 1.2 编译器的结构 编译器可以分为分析部分和综合部分 分析（analysis）部分 &#x2F; 前端（front end） 把源程序分解成组成要素，以及相应的语法结构； 使用这个结构创建源程序的中间表示； 同时收集和源程序相关的信息，存放到符号表； 综合（synthesis）部分 &#x2F; 后端（back end） 根据中间表示和符号表信息构造目标程序； 前端部分是机器无关的，后端部分是机器相关的； 编译器分成执行顺序的一组步骤： 1.3 词法分析 词法分析&#x2F;扫描（lexical analysis&#x2F;scanning） 读入源程序的字符流，输出为有意义的词素（lexeme） &lt;token-name, attribute-value&gt; token-name：由语法分析步骤使用； attribute-value：指向相应的符号表条目，由语义分析&#x2F;代码生成步骤使用； 例子 position &#x3D; initial + rate * 60 &lt;id, 1&gt; &lt;&#x3D;, &gt; &lt;id, 2&gt;, &lt;+, &gt; &lt;id, 3&gt; &lt;*, &gt; &lt;number, 4&gt; 1.4 语法分析 语法分析&#x2F;解析（syntax analysis&#x2F;parsing） 根据各个词法单元的第一个分量来创建树型的中间表示形式，通常是语法树（syntax tree） 中间表示形式指出了词法单元流的语法结构； 1.5 语义分析 语义分析（semantic analysis） 使用语法树和符号表中的信息，检查源程序是否满足语言定义的语义约束； 同时收集类型信息，用于代码生成、类型检查、类型转换； 1.6 中间代码生成 根据语义分析输出，生成类机器语言的中间表示； 三地址代码（three-address code） 每个指令最多包含三个运算分量；很容易生成机器语言指令； 1.7 中间代码优化 通过对中间代码分析，改进中间代码的质量；（更快、更短、能耗更低） 1.8 代码生成 把中间表示形式映射成目标语言；（寄存器分配、指令选择） 1.9 其他 符号表管理：记录源程序中使用的变量的名字，收集各种属性； 编译器构造工具：扫描器（Lex）、语法分析器（Yacc）、语法制导的翻译引擎； 程序设计语言的新发展向编译器设计者提出新的要求 设计相应的算法和表示方法来翻译和支持新的语言特征，如多态、动态绑定、类、类属 (模板) 、… 编译器设计者还需要更好地利用新硬件的能力 RISC技术、多核技术、大规模并行技术 1.10 程序设计语言的基础概念 静态&#x2F;动态： 静态：支持编译器静态决定某个问题； 动态：只允许在程序运行时刻作出决定； 作用域： x的作用域指程序文本的一个区域，其中对x的使用都指向这个声明； 静态作用域（static scope）: 通过静态阅读程序可决定； 动态作用域（dynamic scope）: 运行时确定x的指向； 环境与状态： 环境（environment）: 是从名字到存储位置的映射； 状态（state）: 从存储位置到它们值的映射；","tags":[{"name":"points","slug":"points","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/points/"}],"categories":[{"name":"tidbits","slug":"tidbits","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/tidbits/"}]},{"title":"Summa | The Majority of Memory Categories","date":"2023-07-20T08:41:53.000Z","path":"jottings/architecture/summa_memory_categories/","text":"Reproduced in 8 types of memory every embedded engineer should know about! The majority of memory can be categorized as shown in the following picture: The real difference between primary and secondary memories is the speed&#x2F;volatility(without power) tradeoffs. Primary MemoryPrimary memory is very fast, but it cannot hold data without power. The popular name for Primary Memory is RAM, which has 2 most important types namely SRAM and DRAM. Bistable Circuit usually consists of two complementary transistors or other switching devices, one used to hold the circuit in one stable state and the other to switch the circuit to another stable state. The switch between these two states is triggered by the input signal. Bistable Circuit can store data. Latches and registers are bistable devices. SRAM is the use of bistable flip-flop to save information, as long as the power is not lost, the information is not lost. DRAM uses capacitors to store charge to store information, so data stored in the DRAM must be constantly refreshed every few milliseconds or else it will end up being erased. The action is taken care of by a special device named DRAM controllers. SRAM DRAM Construction Principle It uses a cross-coupled flip flop configuration of transistors It uses a capacitor transistor circuit to hold data Cost Relatively more expensive, it needs more transistors per bit of data it can store Relatively less expensive, as fewer transistors per bit of storage are needed Speed Faster Slower (capacitor charge and discharge time) Volatility As long as power is ON, it can store data since it uses no capacitors Data needs to be continuously refreshed (usually in the order of 4 times a second) since the capacitors leak power. Power consumption Less More Density Less dense (6 transistors, more area needed) Highly dense (1 pass transistor and 1 capacitor, easy to integrate) Addition components needed None DRAM controllers are needed to make it work like an SRAM. This controller offloads the data refreshing duties of a microprocessor and hence a DRAM coupled with a DRAM controller behaves more like an SRAM from the processor’s perspective. Application areas Cache memory (Ls2) Main memory (memory chips) NVRAM or Non Volatile Random Access Memory, is a special type of RAM that can store data permanently. It’s basically an SRAM with a power supply Secondary MemoryROM MASK ROM: The main characteristic of this device is the fact that the data is written onto the device as it gets manufactured and it is impossible to change them. This is done by designing the chip in such a manner so that it already contains the necessary data. In order to mass production, the manufacturer makes a ROM or EPROM with original data as a sample in advance, and then mass-produces the same ROM as the sample. This kind of ROM sample for mass production is the MASK ROM, and the data burned in the MASK ROM can never be modified. PROM stands for Programmable Read-Only Memory. These are programmable chips for user needs, the main characteristic being it can only be programmed one time. That is it cannot be erased or reprogrammed. They are also known as One Time Programmable devices or OTPs for short. EPROM stands for Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory. These chips usually have a small glass window on top and if you expose them to direct sunlight(UV, ultraviolet) that will erase the chip’s data. They can then be programmed again with fresh data. Cons: Inconvenient, instability, can not be exposed to the light source otherwise easy to lead to data loss EEPROM stands for Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory. These chips can be erased and reprogrammed using electricity as opposed to exposing them to UV rays as EPROMs. EEPROM can be erased and reprogrammed on a computer or dedicated device, generally plugging and playing. FLASH MEMORY The basic storage unit of flash memory is the transistor-based storage unit, and each storage unit can store 1 bit of data. Storage units are usually organized into a block, and each block contains thousands of storage units. Each storage unit has a floating gate to store electric charges. The state of a storage unit can be determined as “1” or “0” based on the amount of electric charges stored in the floating gate. The state of a storage unit is changed by injecting or extracting electrons into&#x2F;from the floating gate to modify the amount of electric charges stored in it. Flash memory uses Hot carrier injection(HCI) mechanism to write data. In simple terms, a certain storage unit is grounded at the source, a positive voltage is applied to its control gate, and a positive voltage is applied to the drain to generate a strong electric field between the source and drain. This will give electrons enough energy (hot carriers) to be attracted by the voltage at the control gate and injected into the floating gate. Afterwards, as the insulating material on the top and bottom of the floating gate is not conductive, these electrons are trapped in the floating gate and cannot escape. (Every time electrons enter and exit the surrounding silicon dioxide on the floating gate, it will cause aging[1]) To save cost, flash memory adopts page programming mode. Each page contains a certain number of storage units, and all units in a page are written at the same time. Cons: Flash memory has the issue of wear-out (write&#x2F;erase endurance limits), which is usually mitigated by disabling bad blocks, and then reducing usable capacity. USB flash disk, namely “U disk”, is a new generation of storage devices based on USB interface and flash memory chip as storage medium. It is basically composed of five parts: USB port, main control chip, flash memory chip, PCB backboard, outer package. USB flash drives, SD cards, and SSDs are a type of storage device that uses flash memory chips as the storage medium. They are primarily composed of a controller (main control) and flash memory chips, and have no mechanical structure, consisting purely of electronic circuitry. They are resistant to physical shocks and impacts. The controller manages data storage and other functions. Even after power loss, data remains stored in the memory cells. USB flash drives generally have a cache on them to prevent the loss of data copies from being quickly plugged in&#x2F;out. OTHER Hard Disk Drive: The disk reads data according to the polarity of the magnetic particle and writes data according to the polarity of the magnetic head. Compact Disk: CD-ROM can only be read and not written to because after being burned once, each unit has a fixed different reflectivity (the reading probe emits laser and the reflected laser is read as “1”, or non-reflected laser is read as “0”). Floppy Disk: A type of magnetic disk, less capacity, slower speed.","tags":[{"name":"memory","slug":"memory","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/memory/"}],"categories":[{"name":"architecture","slug":"architecture","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/architecture/"}]},{"title":"Welcome to Yue's Jotter","date":"2023-07-13T08:23:57.000Z","path":"jottings/intro/","text":"","tags":[],"categories":[]},{"title":"Summa | Firmware and Drivers","date":"2023-07-13T06:21:53.000Z","path":"jottings/architecture/summa_firmware_and_drivers/","text":"Reproduced in Firmware vs Device Drivers: Explained with Examples! Firmware vs. Device Drivers Firmware Device Drivers Firmware is a class of software that is written for specific custom hardware. Device drivers are software that is needed to make a given hardware accessory Firmware lives and runs directly on the hardware. Device drivers live on hard-disk and run on the CPU. Firmware is independent of an operating system, i.e., you can run any operating system on top of a given motherboard’s firmware. Device drivers are highly dependent on the operating system on which they are used. For example, for the same hardware device, you need different device drivers for using that on Windows vs Linux. Firmware cannot be updated through an operating system, we need to go into the BIOS&#x2F;UEFI to update the device drivers. Drivers can be updated from within the operating system. Firmware engineers do not need any knowledge of operating systems. But they need core knowledge on processors and the latest RAMs, PCIe standards, and so on to write firmware that complies with the latest standards Device driver engineers need knowledge about the specific device that they are using, the communication standard the device uses to talk to the computer (like Bluetooth, USB, etc), and the operating system the device driver is written for. Firmware is written by motherboard manufacturers Drivers are written by engineers in companies that produce hardware accessories that connect to your computer Examples include the BIOS&#x2F;UEFI interface that comes with the computer’s motherboard Examples include special software you install to handle the extra buttons on your mouse, software that comes with any non-standard hardware like special game controllers, also the software that helps us use all the standard hardware like USB storage devices, keyboards, mice, headphones, etc. Layers of software on a typical computer are shown in the following figure: Firmware​ Firmware is a computer program that is written to work directly on specific custom hardware and it lives in non-volatile memory such as a flash chip and it is executed directly from it. The job of the firmware is to make the hardware accessible to the operating system. Firmware can be thought of as the glasses through which the operating system can see the actual hardware! ​ Originally Firmware is written on Masked ROMs, which is a special type of memory that can be programmed&#x2F;written-data-to only once. The products were then shipped with these unchangeable programs called firmware and they run for ages till the device goes out of use. ​ The first replacement of Masked ROMs came in the form of EPROM which can be erased by exposure to UV light and then reprogrammed as required. Then came EEPROMs which used electricity to change the contents. Nowadays the Masked ROMs have been replaced with Flash memory, which is cheaper and serves the purpose. Device DriversDevice drivers are programs that can control a given hardware and provide a software interface to it. Other programs like Operating Systems can interact with the hardware through this software interface without needing to know the actual underlying implementation of the software interface. The relation graph between firmware and drivers is also shown below: ​ Generally speaking, drivers and firmware together form the module that operates hardware. But why not make the firmware perfect so that it doesn’t require driver support? ​ The answer to the above question is, there are different operating systems which have completely different ways of operating hardware. So, on the one hand, hardware manufactures need to write firmware to make their hardware easier to use with software, but on the other hand, they cannot make the firmware too rigid in order to be compatible with various operating systems. They must leave enough room for software to freely operate —— and that’s where drivers come in.","tags":[{"name":"firmware","slug":"firmware","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/firmware/"},{"name":"driver","slug":"driver","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/driver/"}],"categories":[{"name":"architecture","slug":"architecture","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/architecture/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"languages","slug":"languages","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/languages/"},{"name":"shell","slug":"languages/shell","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/languages/shell/"},{"name":"tidbits","slug":"tidbits","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/tidbits/"},{"name":"networks","slug":"networks","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/networks/"},{"name":"mathematics","slug":"mathematics","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/mathematics/"},{"name":"statistical_ml","slug":"statistical-ml","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/statistical-ml/"},{"name":"python","slug":"languages/python","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/languages/python/"},{"name":"architecture","slug":"architecture","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/categories/architecture/"}],"tags":[{"name":"shell","slug":"shell","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/shell/"},{"name":"linux","slug":"linux","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/linux/"},{"name":"networks","slug":"networks","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/networks/"},{"name":"math","slug":"math","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/math/"},{"name":"algebra","slug":"algebra","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/algebra/"},{"name":"statistic","slug":"statistic","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/statistic/"},{"name":"ml","slug":"ml","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/ml/"},{"name":"python","slug":"python","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/python/"},{"name":"optimization","slug":"optimization","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/optimization/"},{"name":"points","slug":"points","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/points/"},{"name":"memory","slug":"memory","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/memory/"},{"name":"firmware","slug":"firmware","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/firmware/"},{"name":"driver","slug":"driver","permalink":"https://stu-yue.github.io/tags/driver/"}]}
